## Design Documentation

This section provides an overview of the design choices made in the project:

- **Color Schemes**: 
  - The color palette is inspired by modern streetwear aesthetics, utilizing vibrant colors like purple for primary actions, which evokes a sense of creativity and energy. 
  - Muted tones, such as grays and whites, are used for backgrounds to create a balanced visual hierarchy, ensuring that the vibrant colors stand out without overwhelming the user.
  - Accent colors are strategically used to highlight important elements, such as buttons and links, enhancing user interaction.

- **Component Architecture**: 
  - The project follows a modular component architecture, allowing for reusable components across the site. This approach promotes consistency in design and functionality.
  - Each component is encapsulated with its own styles and scripts, making it easier to maintain and update individual parts of the application without affecting others.
  - The use of SCSS allows for nesting and variables, which simplifies the styling process and enhances readability.

- **Responsive Design**: 
  - The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. 
  - Media queries are employed to adjust layouts and styles based on the viewport size, providing an optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
  - Flexbox and grid systems are utilized to create fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that content is always accessible and visually appealing.

- **User Experience (UX)**: 
  - The design prioritizes user experience by ensuring intuitive navigation and clear calls to action. 
  - Interactive elements, such as buttons and links, are designed to be easily identifiable and accessible, enhancing usability.
  - Feedback mechanisms, such as hover effects and loading indicators, are implemented to inform users of their actions and the system's response.
